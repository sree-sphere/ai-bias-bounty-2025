# Loan Approval Fairness Audit Report

## 1. Introduction

This report documents the development and fairness audit of a logistic regression model for predicting mortgage loan approvals. I focus not only on predictive performance (accuracy, AUC, balanced accuracy) but also on detecting and quantifying disparate treatment across key sensitive attributes.

**Sensitive Attributes:**
- Gender  
- Race  
- Age_Group  
- Citizenship_Status  
- Disability_Status  
- Criminal_Record

## 2. Data Overview & Exploratory Analysis

- **Target:** `Loan_Approved` (1 = Approved, 0 = Denied).
- **Base Approval Rate:** 0.4315 (43.1)%.

### 2.1 Categorical Distributions & Approval Rates

| Attribute       | Groups & Counts / Approval Rates                             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Gender**    | Female (29.2% applied, 68.4% approved)
                   Male (26.4% applied, 85.5% approved)
                   Non-binary (1.35% applied, 50.4% approved) |
| **Race**      | White (32.6%/84.1%), Black (8.4%/56.9%), Hispanic (10.9%/62.7%),  
                   Asian (3.3%/82.9%), Multiracial (1.1%/88.2%),  
                   Native American (0.54%/74.1%) |
| **Age_Group** | 25–60 (30.9%/79.8%), Over 60 (19.6%/72.1%), Under 25 (6.3%/68.5%) |

### 2.2 Continuous Features

- **Income**: median nearly \$80K; bottom 20% below \$55K with approval < 30%  
- **Credit_Score**: strong predictor of approval  
- **Loan_Amount**: mean nearly \$252K; similar across groups

## 3. Scenario-Based Subgroup Checks

1. **Criminal Record Prevalence**
   - Gender: F 7.5%, M 8.2%, NB 8.9%  
   - Race: Native Am 10.6%, Multiracial 9.7%, Black 8.1%, Hispanic 8.5%, White 7.8%, Asian 5.4%  
   - Zip: 7.2%–8.6% across neighborhoods  

2. **Average Loan Amount**
   - Gender: F \$250.8K, M \$254.8K, NB \$246.0K  
   - Race: all within \$246K–\$255K  

3. **Black Applicant Analysis**
   - Denied (837 cases): avg \$259.7K  
   - Approved (476 cases): avg \$247.5K  
   -> Denied Blacks request \$12K more on average, but overall loan sizes don’t differ markedly by race.

4. **Low-Income Approval**
   - Bottom 20% income (below \$55,089):  
     Female 28.5%, Male 29.9%, NB 27.3%  

5. **Intersection: Disability & Criminal Record**
   - Approval rate = 24.5% (98 samples)
   -> The most disadvantaged subgroup.

**Bottom-Line Takeaways:**
- Race drives larger criminal-record imbalances than gender.
- Loan amount requests are uniform across groups.
- Low-income applicants have very low approval rates uniformly.
- Disabled + criminal-record applicants are extremely under-approved.

> **80% Rule Threshold**: DI between 0.8–1.25 is acceptable.
> - **Gender**, **Race**, **Age**, **Citizenship** are near or slightly above the bound.
> - **Disability** and **Criminal_Record** far exceed it, indicating over-compensation or reverse-bias.

## 8. Conclusions & Recommendations

1. **Model Performance** remains solid (AUC 0.678, balanced accuracy 0.634) after pruning to top SHAP features.

2. **Fairness Concerns** are most severe for:
   - **Disability_Status = Yes** (DI = 2.036, SR gap = 27.0%, FNR gap = 25.1%)
   - **Criminal_Record = Yes** (DI = 2.812, SR gap = 33.9%, FNR gap = 41.7%)

3. **Fairness Mitigation Experiments**
   - **Reweighing** (AIF360):  
     - Post‑reweighing accuracy rose to **64.95%** (from 63.15%)
     - Balanced accuracy improved slightly to **0.636**
     - Gender DI dropped from 1.40 -> _1.15_; Race DI from 1.23 -> _1.05_; Disability_Status DI from 2.04 -> _1.40_; Criminal_Record DI from 2.81 -> _1.75_.
   - **Equalized Odds Postprocessing** (Fairlearn ThresholdOptimizer on Gender):  
     - Accuracy modestly decreased to **62.75%**
     - Gender FNR gap closed to **< 2%**, achieving near parity.
     - Other attributes remain to be tested under EO constraints.

**Recommendation:**
- Adopt **reweighing** as an in‑pipeline fairness correction, since it improved both performance and lowered DI across all sensitive features into acceptable ranges (0.8–1.25) for most groups.
- Follow up with **threshold optimization** on remaining high‑impact axes (Disability_Status, Criminal_Record) to further reduce disparities in false negatives.

## 9. Model Comparison & Justification

Before settling on my final SHAP‑pruned, fairness‑audited logistic regression, i benchmarked several alternative classifiers on the same train/validation split.

Finally, on the *test set* I observed:

| Model                    | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|--------------------------|----------|----------|
| Logistic Regression      | 0.6530   | 0.6500   | <= best performance
| LightGBM                 | 0.6200   | 0.5238   |
| K‑Nearest Neighbors      | 0.5715   | 0.5226   |
| Random Forest            | 0.6230   | 0.5123   |
| XGBoost                  | 0.5855   | 0.4973   |
| Neural Network (MLP)     | 0.5720   | 0.4911   |
| Shap-pruned (on Log Reg) | 0.6315   | 0.6300   | <= chosen model

I also checked a variety of tuned and ensemble methods:

| Model                           | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|---------------------------------|----------|----------|
| Enhanced Logistic Regression    | 0.6440   | 0.5540   |
| CatBoost                        | 0.6270   | 0.5897   |
| ExtraTrees                      | 0.6150   | 0.5717   |
| Voting Ensemble                 | 0.6125   | 0.5758   |
| Tuned LightGBM                  | 0.6095   | 0.5730   |
| Tuned Random Forest             | 0.6140   | 0.5638   |
| Gradient Boosting               | 0.6095   | 0.5164   |
| Enhanced XGBoost                | 0.6025   | 0.5083   |
| Enhanced Neural Network (MLP)   | 0.6330   | 0.4959   |

### Why did I trade off accuracy for fairness?

1. **Balanced Performance**  
   - Baseline logistic regression showed only a marginal gain (~2%), making the pruned model a flexible choice.
   - Matches or exceeds most tree methods (LightGBM, CatBoost) in accuracy and F1, while avoiding severe overfitting.

2. **SHAP Interpretability**  
   - Coefficients are directly and better *interpretable* in terms of log‑odds.  
   - SHAP‑based feature pruning provides further highlights the most influential predictors. Since the event finds both accuracy and interpretability to be crucial.

3. **Fairness Integration**  
   - Logistic regression seamlessly integrates with AIF360's reweighing and Fairlearn's ThresholdOptimizer in postprocessing.

4. **Simplicity & Stability**  
   - No extensive hyperparameter tuning required.
   - Lower computational cost and easier reproducibility compared to large ensembles.

> **Note:** While stacking and voting ensembles marginally improve accuracy, they complicate fairness interventions (like  threshold tuning per subgroup). For a fairness‑critical application, the transparent, SHAP‑pruned logistic regression offers the best trade‑off.
